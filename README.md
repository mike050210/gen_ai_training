# Gen-AI Training for Java Developers

This project aims to help Java developers to understand the basic concepts of
Generative AI and how to implement solutions using the Java language.

# Project Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Edit your run configurations to add the following environment variables:
   ```
   OPEN_AI_KEY=<Your OpenAPI Key>
   OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT=<Your OpenAPI Endpoint>
   OPEN_AI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<The GPT Model >
   ```
3. Run the SpringBoot Application. The application would start on the port 8080 by default.

**Note:** You can modify the Gen-AI Settings like the temperature or the maximum
    tokens within the `application.properties` file.

## REST Endpoints

}
```
_Response 1_
```json
{
    "response": "Sure! Here are a few advantages of using Java:\n\n1. Platform independence: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This cross-platform compatibility makes Java a popular choice for building enterprise-level applications.\n\n2. Object-oriented programming: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, which promotes modular and reusable code. This helps in building robust and scalable applications.\n\n3. Rich API: Java provides a vast collection of pre-built libraries and APIs, ranging from graphics rendering to networking and database connectivity. These APIs save development time and effort by providing ready-to-use solutions.\n\n4. Memory management: Java uses automatic garbage collection, which helps in managing memory allocation and deallocation. Developers don't need to worry about manual memory management, improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of memory leaks.\n\n5. Strong community support: Java has a large and active community of developers, which means you can find extensive documentation, forums, and resources to learn, troubleshoot, and collaborate on Java projects.\n\n6. Security: Java has built-in security features, such as sandboxing, that protect against malicious activities. It also supports cryptography and secure socket layers (SSL) for secure communication.\n\nThese advantages are just a glimpse of what Java offers. It is a versatile language used in a variety of domains, including web development, mobile app development, and enterprise software."
