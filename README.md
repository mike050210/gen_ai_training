# Gen-AI Training for Java Developers

This project aims to help Java developers to understand the basic concepts of
Generative AI and how to implement solutions using the Java language.

# Project Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Edit your run configurations to add the following environment variables:
   ```
   OPEN_AI_KEY=<Your OpenAPI Key>
   OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT=<Your OpenAPI Endpoint>
   OPEN_AI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<The GPT Model >
   ```
3. Run the SpringBoot Application. The application would start on the port 8080 by default.

**Note:** You can modify the Gen-AI Settings like the temperature or the maximum
    tokens within the `application.properties` file.

## Qdrant Vector DB Setup
1. Install Rancher Desktop from
   [this link](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/releases).
2. Run the command `docker compose up -d` and verify the following link to
   validate the proper installation in the local environment:
   [Qdrant Local Dahsboard](http://localhost:6333/dashboard).

_Response 1_
```json
{
    "response": "Sure! Here are a few advantages of using Java:\n\n1. Platform independence: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This cross-platform compatibility makes Java a popular choice for building enterprise-level applications.\n\n2. Object-oriented programming: Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, which promotes modular and reusable code. This helps in building robust and scalable applications.\n\n3. Rich API: Java provides a vast collection of pre-built libraries and APIs, ranging from graphics rendering to networking and database connectivity. These APIs save development time and effort by providing ready-to-use solutions.\n\n4. Memory management: Java uses automatic garbage collection, which helps in managing memory allocation and deallocation. Developers don't need to worry about manual memory management, improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of memory leaks.\n\n5. Strong community support: Java has a large and active community of developers, which means you can find extensive documentation, forums, and resources to learn, troubleshoot, and collaborate on Java projects.\n\n6. Security: Java has built-in security features, such as sandboxing, that protect against malicious activities. It also supports cryptography and secure socket layers (SSL) for secure communication.\n\nThese advantages are just a glimpse of what Java offers. It is a versatile language used in a variety of domains, including web development, mobile app development, and enterprise software."

One Hundred Years of Solitude (Spanish: Cien a√±os de soledad, Latin American Spanish: [sjen Ààa…≤os √∞e soleÀà√∞a√∞]) is a 1967 novel by Colombian author Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez that tells the multi-generational story of the Buend√≠a family, whose patriarch, Jos√© Arcadio Buend√≠a, founded the fictitious town of Macondo. The novel is often cited as one of the supreme achievements in world literature. It was recognized as one of the most important works of the Spanish language during the 4th International Conference of the Spanish Language held in Cartagena in March 2007.
The magical realist style and thematic substance of the book established it as an important representative novel of the literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s, which was stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement.
Since it was first published in May 1967 in Buenos Aires by Editorial Sudamericana, the book has been translated into 46 languages and sold more than 50 million copies. The novel, considered Garc√≠a M√°rquez's magnum opus, remains widely acclaimed and is recognized as one of the most significant works both in the Hispanic literary canon and in world literature.
